## Requirements

First, install `node` using your prefered method. I suggest using `nvm`, you can see the docs [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). You need version 20 or greater.

This project uses `pnpm`, refer to the documentation for installation steps.

If you have `npm` already installed, you can install `pnpm` like this:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Getting Started

Install dependencies, then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
